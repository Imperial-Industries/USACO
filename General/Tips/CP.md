Competitive programming (CP) is *not* software development.<br>
The goal of each program is to compute the correct answer quickly using a quick implementation.<br>
Readability, scalability, and maintainability do not matter in CP.
> As long as you can read and edit it, the code is fine.

USACO:<br>
The USA Computing Olympiad is a national programming competition that occurs four times a year, with December, January, February, and US Open (March) contests. The regular contests are four hours long, and the US Open is five hours long. Each contest contains three problems. Solutions are evaluated and scored against a set of predetermined test cases that are not visible to the student. Scoring is out of 1000 points, with each problem being weighted equally (~333 points). There are four divisions of contests: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. After each contest, students who meet the contest-dependent cutoff for promotion will compete in the next division for future contests.
